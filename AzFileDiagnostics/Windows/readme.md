#  AzFileDiagnostics script for Windows

The AzFileDiagnostics script automates detection of most of the common symptoms mentioned in the [Azure Files troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems) and mounts the file share on the client machine. 

## How to download the PowerShell script

- Go to: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples
- Click **Code** and then click **Download ZIP.**
- Open the **azure-files-samples-master.zip** file and the script is located in the **AzFileDiagnostics\Windows** directory.

## How to run the PowerShell script

**Note:** To run the AzFileDiagnostics script, launch PowerShell as an administrator. 

The script can run without any parameter and it will perform basic validations without needing storage account information:

```powershell
.\AzFileDiagnostics.ps1
```

Alternatively, you can specify optional parameters when running the script if you wish to perform validations against a specific storage account:

Example 1:

```powershell
.\AzFileDiagnostics.ps1 -UNCPath \\storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net\sharename
```

 Example 2:

```powershell
.\AzFileDiagnostics.ps1 -StorageAccountName <name> -FileShareName <name> -Environmentname AzureCloud
```

**Note:** Environmentname specifies the Azure environment. Valid values are: AzureCloud, AzureChinaCloud, AzureUSGovernment. The default is AzureCloud.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| -UNCPath | Azure file share UNC path like storageaccount.file.core.windows.net\sharename. |
| -StorageAccountName | Storage account name where the Azure file share is located. Script will validate the storage naming convention. |
| -FileShareName | Specify the file share name and script will validate the file share name convention. |
| -Environmentname | Specifies the Azure environment. Valid values are AzureCloud, AzureChinaCloud, AzureUSGovernment. The default is AzureCloud. |

## Validations Preformed

- Storage account: Verify the storage account name or UNC path exists.

- Azure VM: If client is using SMB 2.x, verify client is Azure VM in the same region as storage account.

- Port 445: When mounting the Azure file share, verify TCP port 445 is not blocked.
